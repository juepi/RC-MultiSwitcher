# RC-MultiSwitcher
Hardware part of the project. Designed using KiCAD6, gerber files will be provided when work is done. SMT parts used will be taken from the [JLCPCB parts list](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) to allow pre-assembling all the SMT parts.

## Purpose
Provide power to teensy MCU from BEC (up to 7.2V) using LDO regulator provide hardware connections for Servo in- and outputs as wells as low-side switching transistor outputs for LEDs and high-power outputs (up to 2A) using specialized high-side power switches.

## Requirements
The [KiCAD Teensy libraries](https://github.com/XenGi/teensy_library) have been used for this board, they are included in the lib folder.

## Status
This is work in progress.
  
have fun,
